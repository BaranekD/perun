Perun mini applications
====

Mini applications are small one-purpose JS web apps. They are meant for end-users (members of VOs) to configure their settings in user-friendly way.
Apps can be easily styled, so user can identify application directly with each VO without even knowing about Perun system.

Apps structure
====

Common files used by all mini-apps are stored in /bootstrap /css /img and /js folders. If your app require own specific files, please put them as sub-folders of your miniapp. You can base you own mini-apps on example apps used for purpose of MetaCentrum VO (folder /metacentrum).
